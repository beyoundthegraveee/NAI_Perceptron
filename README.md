The aim is to write a program that takes the following arguments: 
- a - a learning constant. 
- Train-set - the name of the file containing the training set in CSV form. 
- Test-set - the name of the file containing the test set in CSV form. 
Implement a perceptron that, using the given train-set and learning constant, 
learns to recognise irises. After learning, the programme should give the percentage of correctly recognised 
flowers from the test-set. The percentages for each species should also be printed out. 
The programme is also to provide a test interface (not necessarily graphical) that allows (looped) 
user input of individual vectors for classification. 
NOTE: The programme should work correctly for any number of attributes. 
Test the programme on iris data, minus one species (you should choose which one) so that 
100 flowers remain - 50 from each remaining species. Divide the data into a set 
training set and test set (35 to the training set and 15 to the test set from each species).
